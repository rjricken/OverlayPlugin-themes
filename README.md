# OverlayPlugin Glow Theme

This is the Glow theme with some modifications I made for my personal use. I plan on keeping it up to date with new XIV patches and expansions.

## Usage
`git clone` or download the ZIP package to a directory (i.e. your ACT directory)

In ACT -> Plugins -> OverlayPlugin.dll settings, for URL, browse to the folder where you extracted the ZIP and then select the HTML file of your choice.
